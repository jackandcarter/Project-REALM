Project: REALM is a community project dedicated to the development of REALM MMORPG.<BR><BR>

REALM is planned to be an open world fantasy role-playing adventure. At the moment the world is in a pre-development state.<br>
This means that it is constantly being reworked, torn down and rebuilt, it's full of bugs and emtpy place-holder objects, and so on.
<BR>
<BR>
Right now the focus is on the authentication, user account front end and account creation, realm selection, character selection, and world placement.<BR>
<BR>
Once this has been expanded on the next focus will be the UI Design. Here are some features planned for REALM:<BR>
<BR>
Dynamic Changing Interface (DCI) - The interface will change based on current class.<BR>
Dynamic Input Manager (DIM) - The user input for casting/attacking/etc will also change based on the Class.<BR>
Spell and Ability Fusion (FUSE) - A manager to allow spell fusion to melee and other weapons and attacks.<BR>
Dynamic Building Plots - (PLOT) - A system to handle dynamic building plot locaitons based on terrain features.<BR>
Arkitect - A sophisticated and advanced building UI and system for players to create buildings and contructs on Plots. <BR>
Open World Building - Players will be able to create empires, similar to guilds in other MMOs, large structures, and buildings and rule small kingdoms dynamically in realm time. <BR>
<BR>

I will add more to the list as I confirm their mechanics and have more details on them.
